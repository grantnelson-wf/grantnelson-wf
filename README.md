## Welcome to Grant Nelson's Workiva Account

I have been a Senior Software Engineer at [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/) since 2014.

At Workiva my main task is to design, build, and maintain
both servers and client side software for highly dynamic
web applications. This includes creating the data structures to support large
amounts of customer data while being fast, highly distributed, and collaborative
among many customers at the same time.
